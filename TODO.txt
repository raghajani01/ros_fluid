Initial conditions:


the job initially in service has no index, and no service time.

a(0), I(0): check the tightness proof to see if assumptions on i.c. is needed.




Dawson measure-valued process, for every <f,\nu>

C-tight.

1. Check the set fset for I_1 in particular, 

	Relevant: \tightset versus \fset


2. The f(w(s-)) thing in applications of lemma 14.


3. K1 for K and A_\ell


4. Almost sure thing in Lemma 5.12 for all fs at the same time.
